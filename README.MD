# ExternalUserFolderFilter

This is a lot like the default ExternalUserFolderProcessor, but it is made into a Spring Filter 

This was done VERY quickly without regard to a production deployment.

A second look at the code should be performed.

#version 6.3 of JRS is the target version. 

#Spring 3.0

The XML file is needed as is the jar obviously.
